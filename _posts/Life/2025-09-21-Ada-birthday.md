## Ada’s birthday at farm!
![Cows](/images/blog/rooster-outside.jpg)

Last Friday was my final day at work. I found it hard to let go when wrapping things up — not only because of the code I had poured time and thought into, but also because I had grown attached to the daily routine. I said goodbye to my coworkers, packed up my work laptop, and mailed it back to the company.


### Cake
That evening, I started making a birthday cake for Ada. At that moment, I left all those emotions behind and devoted myself to stirring, piping, and decorating, as if leaving work had not been such a big deal.

### Thoughs of staying at home
staying at home means making a trade-off: sacrificing some income and career progress in exchange for more time with Ada.. The word “sacrifice” sounds negative, but I prefer to think of it as a special choice. It gives me time with Ada — a kind of time that belongs only to us. We don’t want to send her to daycare yet, since she still cannot walk or talk on her own. At the same time, we don’t want my mother-in-law to bear the full burden of caring for her during the weekdays. As for how long I will stay home, I’m not sure. Maybe just a few months, or maybe a year or two. It depends on when Ada needs more stimulation from the outside world, and also on whether I truly enjoy this season of life.

I was really happy with how the cake turned out. It was my first time trying buttercream frosting and piping, and the result was even better than I expected — a pretty farm-themed cake right in front of me.

On Saturday, Buck and I cleaned the house, blew up balloons, and decorated inside and outside. Ada was so excited when she saw the fresh decorations.

### Enjoy the moment
I hope in the days ahead I can slow down and fully enjoy every moment with Ada.
