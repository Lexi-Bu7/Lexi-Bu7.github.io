## Why Should I Justify My Place in the Conversation?

### When My Opinion Came With Conditions
It began with a Facebook discussion about education policy. I reposted a teacher’s concerns about potential changes to the DOE, especially their impact on special education. I supported my thoughts with data, court rulings, and historical context, thinking they would foster meaningful communication

But the response shifted the focus to me - bringing up my marital status and education - and asked:

*“How long have you lived in the U.S.?”*

**The implication was clear:** I needed to “prove” myself in conversations like these.

I live here and pay taxes. Like anyone else, I am affected by policies on healthcare, education, and immigration etc. This should give me the same right to participate in these discussions. 

**"When people ask for my 'credentials,' their real question is:**  *'Do you have the right to speak on this?'* **"**

But a person's perspective shouldn't be dismissed because of where they were born, how long they've been here or their personal information.

### Criticism Comes from Care
My critique of the country and its leadership decisions also seems to hurt people’s feelings.

But here’s the thing — critiquing a country isn’t rejection, I wouldn't push for better policies if I didn't care about the country's situation and future.

I came here for education and opportunity,  but I stayed because of values: free speech, care for disadvantaged groups, and the idea that everyone desverves dignity regardless of backgroud. Those values matter deeply to me. 

But now, I worry that those values are fading, so I speak up.

### Where Do We Go from Here?
Debates on social media often turn personal, so I'll focus my energy where communication is more productive. But I won't stay silent. This is where I live too, and my voice counts- not because of my background, but because I'm part of the society.

At its best, US has always been a place where people who can speak up. That's a value worth upholding.
